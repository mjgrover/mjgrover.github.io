These are programmed in Java and JSP. The second, called triggers are automated tasks that run in the background when ï¿½triggeredï¿½ by defined actions in Open Pages application. These are programmed in standard Java. The third are custom applications external to Open Pages that integrate over the internet using a REST API. These can be programmed in any language, though demo applications are programmed in VBA and Java. This course is primarily for IBM customers and partners and individuals responsible for defining architectures, configuring software, and implementing solutions for the OpenPages GRC Platform software and associated applications."

There are three types of views that a user can create: Task Views, Creation Views and Grid Views. In addition, students will learn to create Workflows that can be included as a part of these new user interfaces and also use these customized views. These views are created using a custom configuration written in JSON (Javascript Object Notation). An introduction to JSON will be included in this course but it is recommended that students familiarize themselves ahead of time. This course is primarily for IBM customers, partners and services staff, and for individuals responsible for defining architectures, configuring software, and implementing solutions for the OpenPages GRC Platform software and associated applications."

    "description": "The course is intended for Data Administrators that need to prepare for using the DB2 BLU Acceleration facilities of DB2 11.1 for Linux, UNIX and Windows systems. The concepts and facilities of the BLU Acceleration feature of DB2 11 are presented including loading data into column-organized tables and monitoring the processing of SQL statements that access the tables. The DB2 10.5 Fix Pack 4, referred to as Cancun, added support for Shadow tables, a new type of Materialized Query Table, and also Column-organized User Maintained MQT tables. One lecture unit describes these features. A demonstration allows students to implement and experiment with these functions. With DB2 11.1, BLU Acceleration can be used in a clustered multiple database partition DB2 environment. This course includes a lecture and demonstration that allows students to create a set of column-organized tables from an existing set of row-organized tables and execute and analyze the performance of BLU Acceleration in a MPP database. The lab demonstrations are performed using DB2 LUW 11.1 for Linux."

The DB2 10.5 Fix Pack 4, referred to as Cancun, added support for Shadow tables, a new type of Materialized Query Table, and also Column-organized User Maintained MQT tables. One lecture unit describes these features. A demonstration allows students to implement and experiment with these functions. With DB2 11.1, BLU Acceleration can be used in a clustered multiple database partition DB2 environment. This course includes a lecture and demonstration that allows students to create a set of column-organized tables from an existing set of row-organized tables and execute and analyze the performance of BLU Acceleration in a MPP database."

People familiar with the Hadoop technology are aware of other open source products that are used in this environment. This course will give you a foundation to program using the Apache Pig language. There is also overview of ZooKeeper, HBase, and Hive. One of the capabilities of the BigInsights Web Console is the ability to simplify the invocation of Hadoop applications. This course shows how to publish a text analytics application from the BigInsights development environment to a BigInsights server."

At the end of this course, it is expected that you will feel comfortable implementating a new Virtual configuration data model, invoking interactions and creating customization to the Virtual MDM."
